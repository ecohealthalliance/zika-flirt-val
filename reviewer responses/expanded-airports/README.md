The files in this directory are as follows:

- Karissa's Excel file of FLIRT results, comparing the original values from the airports used in the paper and new runs which incorporate additional airports.
- Four CSV files I created from tables within that Excel file.
- R code which reads in the files, joins them appropriately, and runs GLMs comparing the different airport selections.
