This directory contains the following files:

- extractCountsFromData.js, which logs onto the FLIRT database server and pulls the counts.
- The JSON files that I created by pasting the console output from the script.
- R code to load the JSON files, summarize them, and output a few plots.
- The CSV files and .png files which ccomprise the output of the script.
