# In addition, the real numbers are for *all passengers*, not just outgoing
# passengers. That would include incoming, outgoing, and layovers. However,
# layovers are probably a smallish fraction: We know that, in the domestic US,
# two-leg flights constitute like a third or less of trips, and only 1/3 of
# the airports they are at are layovers, so really 1/9 plus a bit of
# passengers in that scenario are laying over. So, we're going to divide the
# "real" numbers in half to get the actual numbers.

# These are the scale factors, which indicate how many FLIRT output or real
# passengers each simulated passenger represents. Assuming (1) that we've
# basically reached Central Limit Theorem with 100000 passengers such that
# randomness isn't affecting the distribution in a significant way, and (2)
# that the schedules in FLIRT are an accurate representation of all schedules,
# we should be able to multiply our FLIRT results by these numbers to see how
# many actual passengers the risk commutes.

# For a second, I was multiplying to factor out the 61 days (8.5 weeks) that
# the simulation was run for, but the 100000 is actually unitless vis-a-vis
# time. It is simply a measure of probability.

# per year". From there, it's simple to scale them to the time period of
# interest.
