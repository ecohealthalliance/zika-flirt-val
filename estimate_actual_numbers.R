# These are the scale factors, which indicate how many FLIRT output or real
# passengers each simulated passenger represents. Assuming (1) that we've
# basically reached Central Limit Theorem with 100000 passengers such that
# randomness isn't affecting the distribution in a significant way, and (2)
# that the schedules in FLIRT are an accurate representation of all schedules,
# we should be able to multiply our FLIRT results by these numbers to see how
# many actual passengers the risk commutes.

# For a second, I was multiplying to factor out the 61 days (8.5 weeks) that the simulation was run for, but the 100000 is actually unitless vis-a-vis time. It is simply a measure of probability.
